RLog
</h1>

With RLog, you can filter your logs or files as you wish and print them in bulk. You can also delete them after parsing to free up space on your device, it is completely user-friendly and coded for ease of use. 

### âœ… Supported Files

|ðŸ“‚ Archive |ðŸ“œ Data |ðŸ“„ Other|
|----------|----------|----------|
|.rar |.csv  |.txt  |
|.zip |.xml  |.log  |
|.7z |.json  |  |
|.tar.gz | | |

### Features

- Since the logs are very large in size, they do not take up disk space with the delete option after processing, and thus you can easily use them if there is no space on your device. 

  - For example: 
You have 100 GB of space left on your device and you have transferred 100 GB of logs to your device, you do not have any space, if you check the box in the program, instead of printing over it, it deletes the unused log as you write. In this way, you will not have any problems. 

- You will not experience confusion with multi-word filtering and multi-file extension support. You can easily organize all your logs and data. 
- It is designed to be used in every field you need, not just for log use. 
- Due to its low size and performance-oriented nature, it can easily work on very large files. You can easily move between multiple large files at the same time.
